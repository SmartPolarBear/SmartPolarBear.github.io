      <description>In the recent two years, thanks to AMD&amp;rsquo;s great job to push the industry forward, we can see the trend that the number of cores of CPU grow rapidly, reaching 8c16t for gaming laptops and high-performance PCs, while the growth of single core performance seems to be slower. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why parallelism plays such a important role in modern programming. With out it, it is impossible to make the most of the progress of hardware.</description>

      <description>Since years before C++ 20&amp;rsquo;s release, I have been keeping a close eye on it. Many new features fairly tickle my fancy, among which are &amp;lt;ranges&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;format&amp;gt; library components. While there&amp;rsquo;s no available implementation for &amp;lt;format&amp;gt; yet, MSVC 16.8 and GCC-10 provides a usable &amp;lt;ranges&amp;gt; which I played with and writes the post for.
My life highly involved closely with programming begins with a long period using C#. Among all the language features of C#, LINQ is the beloved one for me.</description>
